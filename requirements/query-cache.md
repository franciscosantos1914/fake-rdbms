MySQL implements query caching by storing the results of SELECT statements in memory, along with the query itself. This allows MySQL to serve the data faster for identical queries without executing the commands again from the database. The query cache is particularly beneficial for read-heavy applications where the data does not change frequently, as it can significantly reduce latency and improve I/O operations by serving data from RAM instead of disk 1.

The query cache is controlled by several system variables:

query_cache_type: Determines whether the query cache is enabled. Setting it to 0 or OFF disables caching, while setting it to 1 enables caching for all queries except those beginning with SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE. A value of 2 enables caching only for queries that begin with SELECT SQL_CACHE 1.
query_cache_size: Controls the total amount of memory allocated to the query cache. If set to zero, the query cache is disabled. The default value is often around 16MB 1.
query_cache_limit: Specifies the maximum size of individual query results that can be cached. The default value is 1MB 1.
query_cache_min_res_unit: Determines the minimum amount of memory allocated to each block of cached data. The default value is 4KB 1.
It's important to note that the query cache is deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.20 and removed in MySQL 8.0. For newer versions of MySQL, alternative tools like ProxySQL can be used to optimize performance 1.

MySQL's query cache is byte-for-byte identical, meaning the query must be exactly the same to be served from the cache. Even minor differences, such as the case of SQL keywords, can prevent a query from being served from the cache 3.

For prepared statements, the query cache is used under certain conditions, as described in the MySQL documentation. Before MySQL 5.1.17, the query cache was not used for prepared statements 3.

In summary, MySQL's query cache is a powerful feature for optimizing read-heavy applications by caching the results of SELECT statements. However, it's important to be aware of its limitations and the deprecation in newer versions of MySQL.
